# Change Log - School Management System

## Authentication Debugging (May 20, 2025)

### Issue: User being redirected to unauthorized page despite having admin role set in Clerk

#### Changes Made:

1. **[2025-05-20 13:50]** Added debugging logs to middleware.ts
   - Added console logs to display session claims and extracted role
   - Temporarily bypassed role checking if user is authenticated
   
2. **[2025-05-20 13:55]** Simplified middleware with better error handling
   - Completely rewrote middleware to simplify authentication flow
   - Added try/catch block to prevent middleware errors
   - Temporary bypass to allow any authenticated user through
   - Removed complex route matchers to isolate the authentication issue
   
3. **[2025-05-20 14:00]** Fixed missing dependency error
   - Installed 'critters' package which was required by Next.js for CSS optimization
   - This resolved the "Cannot find module 'critters'" error
   
4. **[2025-05-20 14:05]** Fixed TypeScript errors in students detail page
   - Resolved error: "Module '@prisma/client' has no exported member 'Class'/'Student'"
   - Created proper type definitions for Student and Class types
   - Fixed import order to ensure proper TypeScript compilation
   
5. **[2025-05-20 14:30]** Fixed sign-in routing issue
   - Updated sign-in page to use role from user's public metadata instead of organization name
   - Added proper routing based on user role (admin, teacher, student, parent)
   - Added console logging to help debug authentication flow
   - Improved fallback to redirect to unauthorized page when no role is assigned
   
#### Planned Changes:

1. Test simplified authentication to confirm user can access admin pages
2. Once basic access works, gradually reintroduce role verification
3. Set up proper Clerk webhooks to sync user data
4. Complete testing of all protected routes

#### Notes:
- Current issue: Despite having "admin" role set in Clerk dashboard, user is redirected to unauthorized page
- Server errors occurring during middleware execution, preventing proper debugging
- Simplified middleware to isolate and resolve the core authentication issues
